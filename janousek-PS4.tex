\subsection*{4--1. \textbf{Characterization with deflection history} [4 pts].} 
A simply supported beam is made from a material that is well-described by a three-parameter standard linear solid model, i.e., the general creep compliance function $J_c(t)$ is given by
\begin{equation*}
    J_c(t) = J_\infty + (J_0 - J_\infty) \exp\left[-\frac{t}{\tau_c}\right],
\end{equation*}
where $J_\infty$, $J_0$, and $\tau_c$ are all mechanical properties of the material. 

The beam has a length of 4 ft and a second moment of area about the out-of-plane axis of 1 in$^4$. 
It is subjected to a position-time separable load function $q(z,t) = \hat{q}(z) \phi(t)$ where $\phi(t) = -3$ lb/ft $\cdot \mathcal{H}(t)$. 
Say we determine the maximum deflection in the beam at different times to be
\begin{align}
    &u_y \Big|_{\max} = -0.6 \textrm{~in~~at~~}t=30\textrm{~min}\\
    &u_y \Big|_{\max} = -0.75 \textrm{~in~at~~}t=60\textrm{~min}\\
    &u_y \Big|_{\max} = -1.0 \textrm{~in~~at~~}\textrm{~long times}
    \end{align}
From this, calibrate the material properties.

\subsection*{4--2. \textbf{Ramp up the torque} [4 pts].} 
A viscoelastic cylinder $AB$ is fixed on its end $A$ and simply supported on its opposite end at $B$. 
At point $B$, a second, rigid rod is joined to the end such that exerting a force on the rod will induce a counterclockwise torque about the axis of $AB$. 
A point force of magnitude $P_0$ is applied to the rigid rod, causing the front face to turn counterclockwise. 
The point force travels along the rod such that its distance from the bar's neutral axis $a(t)$ is direct in time, i.e., $a(t) = \alpha t$, where $\alpha$ is a constant. 
What is the angular rotation of the end $B$ as a function of time, $\Phi(t)$?

A one-piece polymeric member \textit{ABC} consists of two segments of length $L$ at a right angle from one-another and encastred at $A$, as shown. 
Its neutral axes both lie in the $x-z$ plane when unloaded. 
Assuming the creep compliance in shear to be $\mu_c{t}$ and the creep compliance in axial tension to be $E_c(t)$, determine (a) the deflection at $C$ in terms of the time-varying force $F(t)$ and (b) the stress tensor $\mathbf{\sigma}(t)$ at the square surface element located above $A$.

\subsection*{4--4. \textbf{Fibrous material} [4 pts].}
An elastic material with a fiber phase has the Helmholtz free energy function
\begin{equation*}
\widetilde{\psi}(\bn{F}) = \frac{1}{2}C_{10} (I_1-3) + \frac{1}{4} k (I_a - 1)^2,
\end{equation*}
where $I_1(\bn{C}) = \textrm{tr}(\bn{C})$ and $I_a(\bn{C},\hat{\bm{a}}_0) = \hat{\bm{a}}_0 \cdot \bn{C} \hat{\bm{a}}_0$ for $\bn{C} = \bn{F}^\intercal \bn{F}$.

\newpage
\subsection*{4--5. \textbf{Gent model of rubber elasticity} [4 pts].}
The Gent model, which incorporates the finite extensibility of polymer chains in a rubber network but includes $I_2$-dependence, has a free-energy function of $$\bar{\Psi} = -\frac{C_{10}}{2} J_m \ln \left(1 - \frac{I_1-3}{J_m} \right) + C_{01}\ln \left(\frac{I_2}{3}\right), $$ where $C_{10}>0$, $C_{01}\geq 0$, and $J_m>0$ are material constants.

\medskip
(a) Show that the Cauchy stress corresponding to the free energy above has the form $$\bm{\sigma} = -p \bn{I} + \frac{C_{10} J_m}{J_m - (I_1-3)}\bn{B} - \frac{2C_{01}}{I_2} \bn{B}^{-1}.$$

\medskip
(b) This material undergoes a simple shear deformation of magnitude $\gamma$. Given that the shear modulus $\mu(\gamma^2) \equiv \beta_1(\gamma^2) - \beta_{-1} (\gamma^2)$ where $\beta_i$ corresponds to the expression for $\bm{\sigma}$ in Q1, show that in the small strain limit that $$\lim\limits_{\gamma \rightarrow 0} \mu(\gamma^2) = C_{10} + \frac{2}{3} C_{01}.$$

\textbf{Solution:}

(a)

We start here by computing the individual partial derivatives of $\bar{\Psi}$ with respect to the invariants.
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \bar{\Psi}}{\partial I_1} &= -\frac{C_{10}}{2 \left( \frac{I_1 - 3}{J_m} - 1 \right)}\\
    \frac{\partial \bar{\Psi}}{\partial I_2} &= \frac{C_{01}}{I_2}\\
    \frac{\partial \bar{\Psi}}{\partial I_3} &= 0.
\end{align*}

We can then also write down the derivatives of the invariants with respect to $\bn{F}$.
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial I_1}{\partial \bn{F}} &= 2 \bn{F}\\
    \frac{\partial I_2}{\partial \bn{F}} &= 2 I_1 \bn{F} - 2 \bn{B} \bn{F}\\
    \frac{\partial I_3}{\partial \bn{F}} &= 2 I_3 \bn{F}^{-\intercal}.
\end{align*}

The equation for Cauchy stress that we've derived in class is
\begin{equation} \label{Cauchy_4_5}
    \bn{\sigma} = 2\sqrt{I_3} \frac{\partial \bar{\Psi}}{\partial I_3} \bn{I} + \frac{2}{\sqrt{I_3}} \left( \frac{\partial \bar{\Psi}}{\partial I_1} + I_1 \frac{\partial \bar{\Psi}}{\partial I_2} \right) \bn{B} - \frac{2}{I_3} \frac{\partial \bar{\Psi}}{\partial I_2} \bn{B}^2.
\end{equation}

This equation is of the form $\bn{\sigma} = \alpha_0 \bn{I} + \alpha_1 \bn{B} + \alpha_2 \bn{B}^2$. However, we need the expression for Cauchy stress to be in the form $\bn{\sigma} = \beta_0 \bn{I} + \beta_1 \bn{B} + \beta_{-1} \bn{B}^{-1}$. We can do this using the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem. This theorem states that
\begin{equation*}
    \bn{B}^3 - I_1 \bn{B}^2 + I_2 \bn{B} - I_3 \bn{I} = 0,
\end{equation*}
which lets us express $\bn{B}^{-1}$ as
\begin{equation*}
    \bn{B}^{-1} = \frac{1}{I_3} \left( \bn{B}^2 - I_1 \bn{B} + I_2 \bn{I} \right).
\end{equation*}

Taking Eq. \ref{Cauchy_4_5} and identifying the $\alpha$ coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
    \alpha_0 &= 2\sqrt{I_3} \frac{\partial \bar{\Psi}}{\partial I_3}\\
    \alpha_1 &= \frac{2}{\sqrt{I_3}} \left( \frac{\partial \bar{\Psi}}{\partial I_1} + I_1 \frac{\partial \bar{\Psi}}{\partial I_2}\right)\\
    \alpha_2 &= \frac{-2}{\sqrt{I_3}} \frac{\partial \bar{\Psi}}{\partial I_2}.
\end{align*}

We can now utilize the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem and set the two forms for Cauchy stress equal to each other.
\begin{align*}
    \alpha_0 \bn{I} + \alpha_1 \bn{B} + \alpha_2 \bn{B}^2 &= \beta_0 \bn{I} + \beta_1 \bn{B} + \frac{\beta_{-1}}{I_3} \left( \bn{B}^2 - I_1\bn{B} + I_2\bn{I} \right)\\
    \alpha_0 \bn{I} + \alpha_1 \bn{B} + \alpha_2 \bn{B}^2 &= \beta_0 \bn{I} + \beta_1 \bn{B} + \frac{\beta_{-1}}{I_3} \bn{B}^2 - \frac{\beta_{-1}}{I_3} I_1 \bn{B} + \frac{\beta_{-1}}{I_3} I_2 \bn{I}.
\end{align*}

From this, we're able to compare coefficients and obtain expressions for the three $\beta$ coefficients.

First, we have
\begin{equation*}
    \alpha_2 = \frac{\beta_{-1}}{I_3} \Rightarrow \beta_{-1} = I_3 \alpha_2 = -2 \sqrt{I_3} \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial I_2},
\end{equation*}
then
\begin{align*}
    \alpha_0 = \beta_0 + \frac{\beta_{-1}}{I_3} I_2 &\Rightarrow 2\sqrt{I_3} \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial I_3} = \beta_0 - \frac{2}{\sqrt{I_3}} I_2 \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial I_2}\\
    &\Rightarrow \beta_0 = 2\sqrt{I_3} \left( \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial I_3} + \frac{I_2}{I_3} \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial I_2} \right),
\end{align*}
and finally
\begin{align*}
    \alpha_1 = \beta_1 - \frac{\beta_{-1}}{I_3} I_1 &\Rightarrow \frac{2}{\sqrt{I_3}} \left( \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial I_1} + I_1 \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial I_2} \right) = \beta_1 + \frac{2 I_1}{\sqrt{I_3}} \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial I_2}\\
    &\Rightarrow \beta_1 = \frac{2}{I_3} \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial I_1}.
\end{align*}

The last step is to plug in the derivatives of the free-energy function with respect to the invariants that we've calculated earlier.

\begin{align*}
    \beta_0 &= 2\sqrt{1} \left( 0 + I_2 \frac{C_{01}}{I_2} \right) = 2 C_{01}\\
    \beta_1 &= \frac{2}{1} \left( -\frac{C_{10}}{2 \left( \frac{I_1 -3}{J_m} - 1 \right)} \right) = \frac{C_{10} J_m}{J_m - (I_1 - 3)}\\
    \beta_{-1} &= -2\sqrt{1} \frac{C_{01}}{I_2} = \frac{-2 C_{01}}{I_2}.
\end{align*}

With that, we can then write the final expression for Cauchy stress.

\begin{equation*}
    \bn{\sigma} = 2C_{01} \bn{I} + \frac{C_{10} J_m}{J_m - (I_1 -3)} \bn{B} - \frac{2 C_{01}}{I_2} \bn{B}^{-1}.
\end{equation*}

If we consider that $-p = 2C_{01}$, we obtain the final expression as defined in the question.

(b)

Given a simple shear deformation, we can define the deformation tensor $\bn{F}$ as
\begin{equation*}
    \bn{F} = \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & \gamma & 0\\
        0 & 1 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

With that, we can then compute the left Cauchy-Green Tensor $\bn{B} = \bn{F} \bn{F}^{\intercal}$
\begin{equation*}
    \bn{B} = \begin{bmatrix}
        \gamma^2 + 1 & \gamma & 0\\
        \gamma & 1 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
which is symmetric.

We can then compute the three invariants of $\bn{B}$ as
\begin{align*}
    I_1 &= \tr(\bn{B}) = \gamma^2 + 3\\
    I_2 &= \frac{1}{2} \left( (\tr(\bn{B}))^2 - \tr(\bn{B}^2) \right) = \gamma^2 +3\\
    I_3 &= \det(\bn{B}) = 1.
\end{align*}

So we can then rewrite the shear modulus $\mu(\gamma^2)$ as
\begin{equation*}
    \mu (\gamma^2) = \frac{C_{10} J_m}{J_m - (I_1 -3)} - \frac{2 C_{01}}{I_2} = \frac{C_{10} J_m}{J_m - \gamma^2} - \frac{2 C_{01}}{\gamma^2 + 3}.
\end{equation*}

By taking this to the limit, we get
\begin{equation*}
    \lim\limits_{\gamma \rightarrow 0} \mu(\gamma^2) = \frac{C_{10} J_m}{J_m - 0} - \frac{2 C_{01}}{0 + 3} = C_{10} - \frac{2}{3} C_{01}.
\end{equation*}
